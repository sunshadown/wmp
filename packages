#Create a virtual environment (recommended)
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python ./venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate 
#Solution
PowerShell execution policy is default set to Restricted. You can change the PowerShell execution policies with Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet. To run outside script set policy to RemoteSigned.

Restricted – No scripts can be run.
AllSigned – Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.
RemoteSigned – Downloaded scripts must be signed by a trusted publisher.
Unrestricted – All Windows PowerShell scripts can be run.

for example run visual studio code with admin previlages
PS-powershell C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned 
PS C:\> get-executionpolicy 

pip list  # show packages installed within the virtual environment
deactivate  # don't exit until you're done using TensorFlow
